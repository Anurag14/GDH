This is the source code for the ECCV work "Generative domain-migration hashing for sketch-to-image retrieval"

Due to the new term beginning, I'm really busy these days. The readMe file and model file will come soon.

- by Jingyi Zhang, Fumin Shen, Li Liu, Fan Zhu, Mengyang Yu, Ling Shao, Heng Tao Shen, Luc Van Gool

to be presented on [ECCV 2018](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/) poster section. This work focuses on fast sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) using binary codes.



### [Sketchy Dataset](http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/) (Extended)

- The extra image data mentioned in the paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2U-hnwRkpRrdGZKTzkwbkEwVkk/view?usp=sharing) (NEW). The previous uploaded image data are wrong (apologize for this).

### [TU Berlin Sketch Dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/)

- The images of TU for our experiments can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2U-hnwRkpRrMFVvTmFQa3dmSUk/view?usp=sharing).
